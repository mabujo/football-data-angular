# football-data-angular
AngularJS browser for the football-data.org API

All data from http://api.football-data.org/

To run just clone and navigate to (...) /football-data-angular/app/, it will run fine after a clone, but if using properly or developing you will need to npm install, bower install and run the gulp tasks to compile your code. If you use this anywhere, make sure to replace the API key in app/js/config/apiKey.js with your own API key.
